# Example Spring Boot web service

Purpose of this small project is to highlight how to create a RESTful web service using Spring Boot and how to test it using the Spring `MockMVC` class as (at least for me!) from the documentation is not 100% clear.

## Instructions

`./gradlew build`

will build the project and run all the tests (in this case, `GreetingIntegrationTest`).

Have a look at `GreetingIntegrationTest` to see usage of `MockMVC`.
